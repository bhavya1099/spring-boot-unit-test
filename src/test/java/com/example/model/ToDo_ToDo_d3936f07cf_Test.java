The provided code snippet is just a simple constructor for a class `ToDo` which extends from a super class. There's no business logic to test here. However, if you have a more complex `ToDo` class, here are some general test scenarios you might consider:

1. **Object Creation Test**: Test if an object of ToDo class is created successfully using the default constructor.

2. **Persistence Annotations Test**: If ToDo class is supposed to be an entity in a database, test if the annotations (@Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue) are working as expected. Create an instance of ToDo, save it to the database, and then retrieve it to check if it's the same object.

3. **Inheritance Test**: If ToDo class is extending from a super class, test if it properly inherits all the properties and methods from the super class.

4. **Null Argument Test**: If there are methods in ToDo class that take arguments, test the methods with null arguments and make sure they handle nulls properly.

5. **Field Initialization Test**: If ToDo class has fields that are supposed to be initialized in the constructor, test if the fields are properly initialized after an object is created.

6. **Negative Scenario Test**: If there are methods in ToDo class that can throw exceptions, test the methods with inputs that will cause the exceptions to be thrown.

Please note that these are general test scenarios. For specific test scenarios, we need more information about the ToDo class.
