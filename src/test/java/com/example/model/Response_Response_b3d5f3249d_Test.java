Test generated by RoostGPT for test demoTestGitlab using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Default Constructor Test: Test if the default constructor is creating an instance of the Response class successfully. This is to ensure that an object can be created without passing any parameters.

2. Null Test: Test if the default constructor is returning a non-null object of the Response class. This is to ensure that an instance of the class is being created.

3. Type Test: Test if the object created by the default constructor is indeed an instance of the Response class. This is to ensure that the correct object is being created.

4. Inheritance Test: Test if the Response class is correctly inheriting from its superclass. This is to ensure that the inheritance hierarchy is correctly established.

5. Super Constructor Test: Test if the super() call within the constructor is calling the parent class constructor correctly. This is to ensure that the parent class constructor is being correctly invoked.

6. Exception Test: Test if the constructor is throwing any unexpected exceptions during its execution. This is to ensure that the constructor is handling exceptions correctly.

7. State Test: Test if the object state after calling the constructor is as expected. This is to ensure that the object is in a correct state after creation.

8. Thread-Safety Test: Test if the constructor is thread-safe. This is to ensure that the constructor can be called safely from multiple threads.

9. Memory Leak Test: Test if the constructor is causing any memory leaks. This is to ensure that the constructor is not causing any unnecessary memory usage.

10. Performance Test: Test the performance of the constructor. This is to ensure that the constructor is not causing any unnecessary performance overhead.
